# Basic_CircuitTheory
This is the repository of 100 questions on circuit theory for any Engineer.

Questions are self made or are taken reference from somewhere, the following are the analysis steps for the circuit for learning purpose.
1. Learn the basic concepts seeing the circuit.
2. Solve the circuit, re-learn the concepts missed in step-1.
3. Simulate the circuit in any spice software. (here I am using [LT Spice](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) for the simulation)
4. Validate simulation results with solution in step 2. If not matching re-iterate everything.
